# Visualizing FEMA National Risk Index (NRI) Scores in California

The goal of this assignment is to create a data visualization that answers the question:

> *"How do FEMA National Risk Index scores for counties in California compare to those in other U.S. states?"*

This project focuses on data wrangling, visualization design, and communication of patterns in national risk data.

## About FEMA’s National Risk Index (NRI)

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is a U.S. government agency dedicated to help people before, during, and after disasters. In 2021, FEMA launched the National Risk Index (NRI), a dataset and online tool designed to help communities understand and compare their exposure to natural hazards. The NRI integrates scores for expected annual loss, social vulnerability, and community resilience to produce a composite risk score, which represents a county’s percentile ranking relative to other U.S. counties and ranges qualitatively from Very Low to Very High risk (FEMA, 2025).

## Data Sources & Access

FEMA National Risk Index (2025 Release)
Downloaded from ![FEMA’s Resilience Analysis and Planning Tool (RAPT)](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/0a317e8998534c30a9b2d3861c814d42/?views=Add-Data) as a county-level CSV file.

Note:

The raw data file is stored locally in a data/ folder and is not tracked by GitHub. The data/ directory is included in .gitignore.
This repository contains coursework for HW #2 in EDS 240, which explores county-level natural hazard risk using FEMA’s National Risk Index (NRI).
